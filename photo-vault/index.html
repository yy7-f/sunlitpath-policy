<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p><strong>App:</strong> SecureGallery: Photo Vault</p>
<p><strong>Last updated:</strong> January 2026</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
SecureGallery: Photo Vault (the “App”) is designed with privacy as a core principle.
This Privacy Policy explains how information is handled when you use the App.
</p>

<h2>Photos and Media Access</h2>
<p>
The App requests access to your device’s photo library solely to allow you to select
photos or videos to store inside your private vault.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>All selected media is stored <strong>locally on your device only</strong></li>
  <li>No photos or videos are uploaded to any server or cloud</li>
  <li>The developer has no access to your stored media</li>
  <li>You can revoke photo access at any time via device settings</li>
</ul>

<h2>Camera Access</h2>
<p>
If enabled, the App may request camera access to allow you to take photos directly
into the vault.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Captured photos remain on your device only</li>
  <li>No camera data is transmitted or shared</li>
</ul>

<h2>Biometric & Device Security</h2>
<p>
The App may use biometric authentication (Face ID / Touch ID) or device passcodes
to protect access to the vault.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Biometric data is handled entirely by your device’s operating system</li>
  <li>The App does not store or access biometric data</li>
</ul>

<h2>Advertising (AdMob)</h2>

The App may display advertisements provided by Google AdMob.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>AdMob may collect limited device information for ad delivery and analytics</li>
  <li>No personal photos, videos, or vault content are shared with advertisers</li>
  <li>Ad data handling is governed by Google’s privacy policies</li>
</ul>

<h2>Usage Data</h2>
<p>
Anonymous usage data (such as app stability or crash reports) may be collected
to improve performance and reliability.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>No personally identifiable information is collected</li>
  <li>No vault content is included in analytics</li>
</ul>

<h2>Data Sharing</h2>

We do not sell, rent, or share your personal data.
